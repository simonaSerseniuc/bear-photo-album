#Information

I've created a requests albums file, in which I've mocked pagination for loading the images in each album. Usually, this part should be done on the Backend side, but it was an important feature for this component, since loading many images at once can be very costly.
The same pagination can be applied to the albums list, since there seems to be lot of data to request.
